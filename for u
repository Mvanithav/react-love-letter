Hey Dear,
        Yeah here is the thing, to the love of my life. 
     Happy Birthday! Thanks for being you and being mine. 
     My boii, have a wonderful birthday! I may not tell you each day how much I love you
      but I really do, and I'm happy that you are a year older in maturity, 
     grace, happiness, and good health. Happiest of birthdays to you.
     I wish the god to give you the success...  and
                     
                             HAPPY BIRTHDAY<3
